Question 1
In java, a definition statement is used to declare a variable without
having to assign a value. Then the initilzation statement is used to 
combine declaration and assignemt for the intial value. For example 
"int Variable;", is a definition statement, and then "int Variable = 65;"
is the initilzation. Then you can do "Variable = 400; ", which is an 
assignment statement that changs the value of "Variable" to 400.
