/*
 * Question 2
 * The main difference between int and float is that int is for whole numbers,
 * such as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 while flot is for numbers with fractional or decimal parts
 * such as 1.2, 3.4, 5.6. Int is able to use a significatly larger number set for 
 * whole numbers, while float can't do larger numbers or very small numbers.
